# My-tour

### Small pet project to showcase some development skills. Specifically in this project they are:

- Express (MVC)
- Mongoose
- Pug template
- Bootstrap styling
- Stripe on client

The project has the following structure:
```shell
.
├── bin
├── common
├── components
│   ├── auth
│   ├── bookings
│   ├── reviews
│   ├── tours
│   ├── users
│   └── views
├── config
├── middlewares
├── public
│   └── js
├── services
├── utils
└── views
```

I was more focused on the backend part so the frontend part are mostly badly written and unmaintainable. I paid more attention to the frontend part in other projects.

It is up and running on github pages so you can check it up by the link:

(It is deployed on Render with a free tier and it may take around 1 minute to spin up the machine after a long inactive time)
